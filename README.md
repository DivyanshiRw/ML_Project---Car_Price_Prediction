# ML_Project---Car-Price-Prediction
Dataset is taken from Kaggle.
This model uses Linear Regression for regression task. The model predicts the price of second hand cars based on some features. Features which are used for prediction of car price are: Car Name, Year, Distance, Owner, Fuel, Drive, Type.

Car Name: The name or model of the car.
Distance: The distance already travelled by the car (in kilometres).
Year: The year when the car was purchased.
Owner: The number of previous owners of the car.
Drive: The type of transmission (automatic or manual).
Type: The type of car (sedan, SUV, hatchback, luxury SUV, luxury sedan).
Fuel: The fuel used (petrol, diesel, CNG, etc.).

## This model has 78 % accuracy.

### Something more ....
It is the first ML model which I tried to create myself. (Took some help from internet.... I am still learning..... but haven't copied from youtube or some repository)
Wasn't easy as a beginner because it was difficult to preprocess the data since dataset had both string and int data.
Worked on it for long hours.
Stucked in between a lot of times. Sometimes, thought about dropping the idea.... but still kept working on this.
Finally, the model worked.
I believe the model is not perfect but quite good as a beginner.
